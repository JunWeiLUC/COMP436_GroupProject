  	<h2> Our Memories </h2>

		For the 19 cousins, our brick house story starts with Joe and Ethel, our grandparents. Ethel Klug was born in Omaha, and grew up in Denver and 
	Sioux Falls. She met Joe Moonan through mutual friends when she was attending a teachers’ college in Mankato. They married on November 12, 1912, 
	and settled in Waseca to being our chapter of this story. Grandpa Joe was fond of saying that by the time he was 30 he had five daughters, no teeth, 
	and no hair.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After Rosemary’s death, Joe and Ethel settled into the house. We were surprised to learn, after we were adults, that Grandma and Grandpa were <i>not</i> <!-- would <em> be better? --> 
	enthusiastic about the move. The house was much too big (by that time, only the youngest of their five daughters, Joan, lived at home) and too expensive 
	for their taste, but Joe’s siblings pressured Joe and Ethel to keep the house in the family. Joan told her children that Ethel cried when she found out

	</div>
	the move to the brick house was definite. She loved the white frame house (which we think of as <q>Margie’s house</q>) and disliked the brick house. The heavy 
	drapes separating the rooms made the house dark, and the first thing they did was tear out all the drapes. They wanted to replace the worn carpet in the 
	living room, but couldn’t afford it. Joan said that at first she missed the old house, and felt a bit lost in the big mansion. Joan also talked about what 
	it was like to be alone in the house. It made a lot of scary noises and there was no place that you could sit without having either a door or a window 
	behind you. She said it was a spooky place to be alone.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Some of our collective stories of the house come from stories our parents told us of happenings before we were born. One such story is retold by Marilynn:


	<blockquote>
	
	Grandpa and Grandma decided to move to the Waseca Hotel for the winter months of 1940-41 so they wouldn’t have to heat the brick house. It might have 
	seemed an unnecessary move on the morning of November 11, 1940, since the outside thermometer was pushing 60 degrees. Mom, before her marriage, worked at 
	the IRS in St. Paul, and was in the habit of taking the train to Owatonna on Saturdays after work to spend the weekend in Waseca. Dad would pick her up in 
	Owatonna. November 11 was a Monday, so I’m not certain why Mom was heading home...maybe she felt the barometer falling. In any case, she was wearing light 
	fall clothing for the train ride.
	
	<br><br>
	
	For some reason Mary was alone in Owatonna and decided to take the bus to Waseca to be with the family. Along the way, the bus driver picked up stranded 
	people, among them a young woman from South Dakota who was nearly frozen. Mary brought the young woman to the Waseca Hotel, where they discovered she was 
	the daughter of one of Grandma’s good friends in South Dakota. The young woman thawed out and, from Mom’s telling, they all had a good time being snowed in 
	at the Waseca Hotel.
	
	<br><br>
	
	The storm dissipated the next day. When the family walked up North State Street to take stock of the brick house, they found that the front doors had blown 
	open and there was snow back as far as the staircase.
	</p></blockquote>

	</div>
	Also not within the memories of most of us are the weddings of the Moonan girls. Photos help fill in the blanks.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	All five of the Moonan Girls lived all or some part of their married lives in Waseca or Owatonna, so most of us had the good fortune of growing up with our 
	grandparents as a steady presence in our lives. Thirteen of the nineteen cousins managed to be born in Waseca, not, for the most part, because the nuclear 
	family resided in Waseca on or birth dates but because our mothers chose to return to their parents, their sisters, and their hometown doctor (Orville Swenson) 
	before giving birth. The brick house had a welcoming, revolving door, with our moms, our dads, and all of the babies coming and going. Grandmas must have been 
	an expert at <i>newborn</i><!-- use <em> for emphasis? --> care. So, from our earliest days, our vision of the brick house emerged as home, as refuge, and as the resort of the 
	transitional, the emerging, the celebrating and the kids checking in for a dose of love.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	But some of us had more <q>quality years</q> in the brick house than others. The Friedel, Walbran and Hough children spent their childhood years at least 
	until after Grandma’s death, in Waseca or Owatonna. The Senn children lived away from Minnesota until their family moved back to Waseca in 1952. And the 
	Pinnell children, already disadvantaged by their late births, also missed out on some wonderful memory-building years by moving away from Waseca in late 
	1956, when Tony was only a baby and before Peggy and Mary were born. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Francie remembers the day the Pinnells left for Missouri: <blockquote>I watched your car pull out of the brick house driveway 
	with my mom and Grandma Moonan. Then we went into the house and Grandma cried. She wondered what would happen to 
	you without her.</blockquote>
