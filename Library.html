	<h2>Library</h2>
	
	<p>
	The library, with its pretty glass doors, had a hint of a hush about it. A heavy oak library table dominated 
	the room....Grandma's collection of bride's baskets was kept high on top of the cabinets. The late afternoon 
	sun shone through the colored glass to produce a rainbow of colors....The glass cabinet doors would stick in 
	the summer and come open suddenly, scaring us that they would break.....Grandma used to challenge us to find 
	the one leaded glass panel that was different, due to a repair (north wall, lower right)....At least one among 
	us felt smug that she could open the small drawers under the glass cabinets to find crayons and paper.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The shelves were <i>loaded</i> with books. And there was a special children's section with fairy books; some 
	strangely off-brand, off-beat boys' adventure books, like <i>The Motor Boys in Mexico</i>; a series of books 
	about Constance Dunlop, an early woman detective; and a ten-volume set of <i>Our Wonder World</i>, each thick 
	volume with a theme (<q>The World and Its Peoples</q>, <q>Adventure and Imagination</q>), dating from around 
	1918. There was also a series of small leather-bound books of poems (Robert Burns and others) that <i>seemed</i> 
	like they should be children's books because they were so tiny, but weren't.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Mark remembers that on one of his last visits to the Moonan library, when he was in about seventh grade, he 
	came across a book by Fred Allen, an American humorist and radio personality from the 1940's, containing this 
	repartee: <q>Why would anyone ever want to split an atom?</q>  And the reply, <q>Well, maybe you have a friend.</q>
