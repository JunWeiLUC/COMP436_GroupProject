	Mary, the youngest of us, says, <blockquote>Sadly, I have no memories of the brick house. There is one photo of Grandma 
	holding me as a baby on her lap. I was taken shortly before Grandma died. I think she was sitting in a chair near the 
	bottom off the stairs. I have many happy memories of what I call Aunt Margie’s house. What I would give for the purple 
	bathroom!</blockquote>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Tony and Peggy are in the same boat. (On the bright side, those three youngsters can probably still remember where they left their car keys.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As Pete says, the younger cousins’ memories <q>are more <u>feelings</u> than well-formed images. Trips to Minnesota were always fun and special, and 
	my memories are wrapped up so much with the people who were there. All he aunts were kind and warm, and the uncles always joked around and kidded 
	with us. My clearest mental image is of running I to the house when we first arrived, to meet Grandma walking from the kitchen, drying her hand on 
	her apron and welcoming us with a big smile.</q>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	And Robbie remembers laughter: <blockquote>No one old make little Joanie, our Mom, laugh like Grandpa Joe Moonan did. 
	The worries of raising seven kids went away when Grandpa made her laugh. Hearing his voice and seeing his mischievous 
	smile Mom just giggled like she was eight years old.</blockquote>
