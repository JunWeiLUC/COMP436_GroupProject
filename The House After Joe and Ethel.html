	Mark: <blockquote>Grandma Moonan died on March 21, 1962, and Grandpa sold the house not too long afterward to Helen and Dan Sullivan, who moved down from 
	St. Paul. Helen was Grandpa's sister, our great aunt. She earned her Master's Degree in History. She married Dan Sullivan, whose father was an early investor 
	in 3M. The two of them taught at Bemidji State College and were childless. The suggestion was they led a glamorous life. He played a ukulele. They smoked. 
	Helen had an early version of an electric air freshener machine on the end table next to her chair. I recall she was quite pretty and he handsome in an older 
	way. I visited them with Mom and Dad from time to time. They were nice, interesting, and interested in me. 

	<br><br>
	
	After Helen and Dan bought the home, they closed off the third floor to conserve heat, refinished the basement, and built a double garage just outside the back 
	door. Helen and Dan stored two Cadillacs in the new garage—a sedan and a two-door coupe. The old carriage house continued to stand east of the new garage, at 
	least until about the time the Sullivans sold the house to the Driessens in 1964. 
	</p></blockquote>
	
	<p>
	Grandpa moved into a first floor apartment across from the Waseca Hotel and kitty-korner from the courthouse, about a block from the law office above the bank. 
	He continued to be a vital and fun-loving presence in our lives, meeting us for breakfast at the Busy Bee on Saturday mornings, dropping by our mothers' homes 
	for coffee or dinner, taking groups of the grandkids out for supper at the Fox Inn....Grandpa died on June 9, 1966, after suffering a heart attack while climbing 
	the stairs to his office.
