	<h2>Second Floor</h2>
	
	<p>
				<div style="float:right;">

	</div>
	Now, in our imaginations, we’ll scoot down the staircase to the second floor. Grandma’s bedroom was the <q>Boys Room</q> 
	as labeled on the architect’s drawings, and Grandpa’s bedroom was <q>Mr. Moonan’s Room.</q>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The radiator bench next to Grandpa’s bed was always covered with train schedules. He’d eagerly work up a route for you, 
	if you asked. He subscribed to a great railroad magazine full of tales of runaway trains, rains racing through forest 
	fires, steaming wrecks in ravines, trains in deep snow, etc.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	On the door frame in Grandpa’s bathroom were our measurements, take regularly. And the sink in the main bathroom had a 
	third spigot in addition to the standard hot and cold: a tall, curved spigot labeled <q>ice</q>, which brought hard 
	water to the second floor for drinking. Sheila remembers the iron-rich smell and taste. The water softener <q>capsule</q> 
	was in the laundry room hear the vegetable root cellar. (Was there are hard water spigot in the kitchen as well?)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Jack lived at the brick house for about six months after his brother Joe was born in 1941, and off and on for the next 
	two years. The ante-room to Grandpa’s bedroom was the first <q>stay over</q> room for a grandchild, because it was as 
	close as possible to both grandparents. Sometime during WWII, Jack was supposed to be sleeping in that room when Grandma 
	caught him lifting the blackout shades and risking being caught by the blackout wardens (another Indian tale?) who walked 
	around looking for people recklessly displaying lights the enemy could bomb. Jack was looking for the warden. As we got 
	older, we move from ante-room to the impressive middle bedroom (Sheila always felt like a princess when she slept in that 
	room), and then to the southwest bedroom, lighter and airier.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Francie and Margie lived at the brick house from the spring of 1944 until late fall of 1945, most likely using the southwest 
	second floor bedroom. Francie’s dad returned from Europe in November 1945, and all three Friedels lived at the brick house 
	(probably in the idle second floor bedroom) until they moved to the white frame house on Second Street (<q>Margie’s house</q>).
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Fran and the three Hough children lived at the brick house while Ricky was activated (but not deployed overseas) during the 
	Korean War. Dick remembers a curfew whistle (a 10:00 pm?) that would awaken and scare the wits out of him when he was sleeping 
	in the middle bedroom.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The five Senns lived at the brick house for about a half year after they moved back to Waseca so Mart could join Grandpa’s 
	law practice after Grandpa had a stroke. During that time, Fred was quarantined for scarlet fever with the Friedels at 
	Margie’s house, and the rest of the Senn family was quarantined at the brick house. Francie remembers Grandma braiding 
	Barbie’s hair in front of the mirror in the south bedroom Barbie remembers sleeping in the little alcove next to the south 
	sleeping porch after she and Marilynn had tonsillectomies. And the smell of cloves in the closets. Grandma used to cover apples 
	with cloves, and tuck them in her closets to keep things smelling fresh. The Senns moved to their new house the day Eisenhower 
	was elected President, November 4, 1952.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Linda remembers bats and tennis rackets. Once when Marilynn sat for the Pinnell kids at the big house (always a welcome gig, 
	not just because Joan paid at a piece-work rate), long after bedtime (and far into the night) bats flew out of the attic 
	and all over the house. We chased them around with a broom and a tennis racket. The bats escaped. (Mark now has that tennis 
	racket. By coincidence, the name of the racket is <q>The Bat</q>, and the insignia on the racket is dated 1916.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Kitty remembers Grandma teaching her how to knit, sitting in a bedroom with sun coming in the window (but Kitty never has 
	gotten the mitten thumbs right).
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember the wispy curtains blowing at the windows (and later relegated to the trunk in the big attic or dress up)?
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember Grandma’s clip earrings on her dressing table? Once Francie and Sheila made aluminum foil crowns and Sheila 
	used Grandma’s jewelry for decorations. Grandma was not happy.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Grandma also displayed little statutes and knick-knacks in the bedrooms. Like the friendly <q>guardian angel with children</q>, 
	and the spooky life-sized Baby Jesus statue in the small room offer Grandpa’s bedroom. He made us all a little nervous.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Did you know that Grandma painted the face on the Baby Jesus statue? Grandma was an accomplished china painter. Check for 
	her initials on any painted china you have from the house.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The sunny sleeping porch was the playroom. There were never toys scattered around the house. (In fat, were there ever 
	<i>any</i> toys in the house?) There was a row of school desks in the playroom, so we payed school there. And some 
	block that Pat calls <q>Froebel Blocks.</q> Mom said that Grandma was trained to be a kindergarten teacher, and that’s 
	why she was so good at entertaining us. Robby remembers that the teacher-Grandma could tell a children’s story with 
	mesmerizing precision, and always had a private, gentle word for each grandchild. And do you remember how she corrected 
	us if we said we were <i>done</i> doing something? She’d say, <q>Cookies are done. Children are finished.</q>
