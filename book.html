	<h2><b> The Building of the House </b> </h2>
	<p>Our great grandparents, <i>John Moonan</i> and <i>Rosemary Breen Moonan</i>, built the house in 1916. <i>Dorothy</i> told us when we were young that <i>John</i>, her grandfather, had stood in front of his new, brick house on State Street and said, “Imagine! Shanty Irish building a house like this!”</p>
	<p><i>John</i> and <i>Rosemary</i> were born in <u>Waseca County</u>. <i>John</i> was elected mayor of <u>Waseca</u> in 2897, ounty attorney in 1899, and state senator in 1907. <i>Rosemary</i> graduated from Waseca High School, and taught here for some time. She is described in Child’s History of <u>Waseca County</u> as “a woman of marked ability and force of character.”</p>
	<p>The first sheet of the drawings for the house is dated September 15, 1915, and identifies <i>Peter Moe</i> of <u>Minneapolis</u> as the architect. <i>Moe</i> was born in <u>Norway</u> in about 1880, and immigrated in 1905 He died in 1960 in <u>Arlington, Virginia</u>, after having served as an architect with the Treasury Department, a very good political appointment in those days.</p>
	<p>Before the brick house as built, the frame house that occupied the lot was lifted onto rollers and pulled by horses to its current location at 623 Second Street NW. (Until 1928, Second Street was known as First Street, and State Street was known as Second Street.</p>
	<p><i>John</i> and <i>Rosemary</i> and their children lived in the frame house before its move. <i>Joe</i>, <i>Ethel</i>, and our mothers, the five “Moonan girls” (born from 1913 to 1920), lived in the frame house after its move. After <b>World War II</b>, the frame house became the home of <i>Joe</i> and <i>Ethel</i>’s oldest daughter, <i>Margie</i>, and her husband and daughter (<i>Joe</i> and <i>Francie</i>), and our generation came to know it as “Margie’s house".</p>

	<p>When word reached us in late-2009 that the big brick house in Waseca was for sale, we suddenly found ourselves 
	immersed in an email conversation (often with a photo or two attached) about our childhood years, our grandparents, 
	and our connections to the house. After the house was sold, in January 2011, to a family with six children, we decided 
	to collect our e-mail-shared memories and photos into a book we could give to the new owners (and to ourselves): 
	the story of the big Brick House as we knew it.</p>

	<p>We wish the new family years and years of love-filled fun in the big brick house, and wonderful memories for a 
	lifetime.</p>
