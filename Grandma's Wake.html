  	<h2>Grandma's Wake</h2>
	
	<p><img src="images/child, Reenie.jpg" alt="icon" width = "10%" style="float:left;">
	Reenie: <blockquote>Grandma's wake is quite vivid in my memory. I remember sitting on the window seat in the dining room listening to our great aunts 
	- Grace, Kathleen, and Helen. I didn't remember ever meeting them before and was rather fascinated by their very distinctively different (and strong) 
	personalities.</blockquote>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Ann: <img src="images/child, Ann copy.jpg" alt="icon" width = "10%" style="float:right;">
	<blockquote>My last and perhaps most poignant memory of the brick house: On the day of Grandma's funeral, I was standing near the piano in the living 
	room and I watched Grandpa enter the library where Grandma was serenely and beautifully lying. He knelt down next to her, prayed silently for a few moments, 
	stood and gently bent down and kissed her goodbye.</blockquote>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Marilynn: <blockquote>One more vivid memory from the day of Grandma Moonan's funeral: The house was filled with relatives, many of whom I didn't know but 
	who had a familiar <q>Moonan</q> look. I sat on the bottom step of the staircase and listened to the conversations among the cousins of our mothers' 
	generation as they went up and down reminiscing about all the fun they had in the brick house. It was uncanny. All of the wonders we're sharing now 
	were cast back a generation.</blockquote>
