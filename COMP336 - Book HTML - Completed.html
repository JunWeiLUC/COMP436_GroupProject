	<h1> The Big Brick House: Memories of a Family </h1>
	<h3> Author: The Grandchildren of Joseph and Ethel Moonan </h3>
	
	<h2> Forward </h2>
	
	<p>We are the nineteen grandchildren of Joseph N. Moonan and Ethel Klug Moonan. Our birth years range
	from 1939 and 1961, and our residences range from Connecticut to Oregon. We share countless fond 
	memories of childhood hours spent at our grandparents' home, the big brick house at 610 North State Street,
	in Waseca, Minnesota.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Upon the sale in 2011 of our grandparents' home to non-Moonans for only the second time in its 95-year
	history, we decided to collect some of our photos and nostalgic memories of the house. When the house
	left the Moonan family for the first time, in 1964, the oldest of us was not yet old enough to be 
	nostalgic, and the youngest was not yet old enough to form memories.
	</p>
	
	<h2> The Building of the House </h2>
	
	<p> Our great grandparents, John Moonan and Rosemary Breen Moonan, built the house in 1916. Dorothy 
	told us when we were young that John, her grandfather, had stood in front of his new, brick house 
	on State Street and said, <q>Imagine! Shanty Irish building a house like this!</q> 
	</p>
	
	<p> John and Rosemary were born in Waseca County. John was elected mayor of Waseca in 2897, county 
	attorney in 1899, and state senator in 1907. Rosemary graduated from Waseca High School, and 
	taught here for some time. She is described in Child’s <cite>History of Waseca County</cite>
	as <q>a woman of marked ability and force of character.</q>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The first sheet of the drawings for the house is dated September 15, 1915, and identifies Peter Moe 
	of Minneapolis as the architect. Moe was born in Norway in about 1880, and immigrated in 1905 He died 
	in 1960 in Arlington, Virginia, after having served as an architect with the Treasury Department, a 
	very good political appointment in those days.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Before the brick house as built, the frame house that occupied the lot was lifted onto rollers and pulled 
	by horses to its current location at 623 Second Street NW. (Until 1928, Second Street was known as First 
	Street, and State Street was known as Second Street.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	John and Rosemary and their children lived in the frame house before its move. Joe, Ethel, and our mothers, 
	the five <q>Moonan girls</q> (born from 1913 to 1920), lived in the frame house after its move. After World War II, 
	the frame house became the home of Joe and Ethel’s oldest daughter, Margie, and her husband and daughter (Joe 
	and Francie), and our generation came to know it as <q>Margie’s house.</q> <!-- would <em> be better? -->
	</p>
	
	<h2> Architecture </h2>
	
	<p>
	We are lucky to have an architect among our numbers. Pat remembers: <i>I can with certainty place one origin of 
	my interest in architecture to the house. I vividly recall lying on my back on the couch in the living room, perhaps 
	at age four or five, with my legs up the back, most of me on the cushion, looking up at the beamed ceiling. My thought 
	at the time was how much more interesting it would be to walk on that ceiling rather than on a flat floor.</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Pat give us this look at the house from an architect’s viewpoint: <blockquote> <i>The Moonan house, for the time 
	of its design and construction in 1915-16, had an unusual mix of elements both innovative and conservative. It 
	shows certain elements of English Tudor Revival (the symmetrical half-timbered gable ends on the street façade, 
	most prominently), a traditionalist historic style popular in the first couple of decades of the twentieth century. 
	At the same time it shares features with the then-popular, more progressive Prairie School, which had originated 
	in Chicago around 1900 and rapidly spread to other areas of the Middle West; the large central fireplace and wide 
	openings between the more public rooms of the house, for example. The two tendencies were both rooted in the Arts & 
	Crafts movement which had begun in 19th century England as a protest against badly-made mass-produced houses and 
	decorative arts.</i> 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<i>The best of the Prairie School and Tudor Revival houses shared a penchant for fine building materials, 
	used in elegantly straightforward, relatively unornamented, ways, and arranged those materials over a technically 
	sophisticated basic structure and mechanical systems. The Moonan house overall is characterized by exactly that 
	formula.</i> 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<i>Quarter-sawn stained oak paneling and trim, high-fired decorative ceramic tiles, Ludowici celadon 
	terracotta roofing tiles, and so on, were combined with behind-the-scenes technical elements such as a long-span 
	built truss to carry the heavy rafters required by the roofing tiles. The oak benches with square-slatted fronts 
	covering cast-iron radiators are another such hybrid.</i> 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<i> More subtly than the architectural style, the use of fine materials, and the technical sophistication, the 
	choice of basic room arrangement exhibits the same mindset of combing elements of traditional formality with planning 
	for a changing world. While there is a formal double <q>front door</q> into the living room, directly on axis with the fireplace, 
	it is clear that it was never intended to be the house’s main entry. Instead the strategy was to make a front layer, a 
	balanced set of three rooms across the street frontage (library, living room, sun room), with their connecting wide doorways 
	arranged on an axis <q>en suite</q>, but then to actually enter the house behind that layer, coming into a second, back layer of 
	spaces (entry, telephone room, stair, dining room, kitchen) which, in contrast with the first, are quite disconnected from 
	each other. It’s a clever and unusual plan, in short, not at all a common arrangement or type. (Frank Lloyd Wright, an adept 
	planner, designed a house with a similar arrangement of rooms in 1906.) the likeliest explanation is that the plan was 
	conceived to deal with carriage or automobile drop-offs at that paradoxical read-layer front door. Further evidence that 
	vehicles were being considered is the additional pair of doors opening into the entry; these look to have been intended to 
	move furniture more easily straight in and out of the house from the height of a truck bed.
	</i> </blockquote>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	And regarding the garage, Pat adds: <i>Interesting historic moment, 1915-16. This would have been the first decade in which 
	more people built garages than stables, and this was clearly a <u>garage</u>. But there were still doubts, and even legal proscriptions, 
	about having gasoline close to the main house, let alone in an attached structure. Hence the distance from the house, 
	otherwise unaccountable in Minnesota’s climate. Also notable that it’s a TWO CAR garage in a time when few families had even 
	one automobile.</i> 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The garage doors faced south. You entered the driveway from State Street, drove past the south side of the house, then turned left 
	(north) beyond the huge oak to enter the garage. In addition to the two parking stalls, the garage had a large room the let (west) 
	of the car area, which looked (at least to a child) like a horse stall. That room had a divided door (up/down) like a stable door. 
	The two main garage doors were very tall. They were constructed in three sections, three or four inches thick. They hung on rollers, 
	and slide to the side, barn-door style. 
	</p>
	
	<h2> While John and Rosemary Lived in the House </h2>
	
	<p>
	When John and Rosemary Moonan moved into the new brick house in 1916, their seven children ranged in age from about five to 26. The 
	oldest, our Grandpa Joe, was already married and not living with his parents. Some of the other older children (Kathleen, Grace, and 
	Helen) may have been at college part of the time, but, in general, the <q>Boys’ Room</q> and the <q>Daughters’ Room</q> (as show on the 
	architect’s Second Floor Plan) were presumably well occupied.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	One of their granddaughters (one of the six children of John and Rosemary’s daughter Kathleen Moonan Fitzgerald) Kate Fitgerald Terrien 
	(born in 1914) shares her recollections from visiting the house from about 1927 to 1935:
	</P>
	
	<p>
	<blockquote><i>The house was big and elegant. The property in back had a big orchard and extended back to the Castors’ house on the other side of the 
	block. . . . The main entrance, with double doors, faced the street, but was not used much. The stoop outside, by the driveway and the 
	sun room entrance to the house, had a concrete slab so that people could get out of a carriage or car and directly enter the house; after 
	dropping off passengers the carriage could be driven to the barn in the back. Later, probably early 1920’s, they had an automobile. Grandma 
	(Rosemary) had a maid named Pauline, who also drove the car; the two drove to Rochester when Grandma had her cancer treatments at the Mayo 
	Clinic; they stayed at our house before she died. . . .There was a large sofa facing the big fireplace in the living room. Grandpa (John) 
	would lie on the couch for a nap after lunch before going back to the office. . . . Grandma (Rosemary) was a disciplinarian but never mean. 
	She had reasons to discipline: For example, my brother Pat got into her car and released the brake, sending her car down the driveway into 
	a tree. Also, during play in 1930’s, we kids would pull the cushions of the sofa. One time when Sheila was about four (and had already broken 
	her collar bones four times), she was wearing a large wooden T-brace on her back as support for a broken collar bone, and someone (probably a 
	brother) was chasing her around the first floor. She tripped on a cushion and re-broke her collar bone.  . . . Grown-ups sat at the dining 
	room table for meals, and a special table was put up nearby where children sat. . . . There usually was a bridge game going on in the sun room, 
	any windows – the brightest room in the house . . . . The library was fascinating, with books to the ceiling . . . . The narrow back stairway 
	from the kitchen to the second floor, for the maid’s use, was a neat thing for kids. . . . There was a sleeping porch upstairs over the driveway 
	where we kids slept. I remember looking down, at a young age, from the balcony outside the sleeping porch (may through slats) and seeing  the 
	car below. . . . There were window seats on the landing of stairs from the first to the second floor. . . . Grandma’s bedroom on the second 
	floor had an entry area that had a settee and lots of piles of newspapers and magazines and embroidered pillows. . . . The third floor was only 
	used for storage.</i></blockquote>
	</P>
	
	<p>
	John Moonan dies suddenly of a heart attack on November 23, 1922. Rosemary lived at the house until her death in Rochester, while visiting her 
	daughter Kathleen, on July 31, 1935.
	</p>
	
	<h2> Our Memories </h2>
	
	<p>
	For the 19 cousins, our brick house story starts with Joe and Ethel, our grandparents. Ethel Klug was born in Omaha, and grew up in Denver and 
	Sioux Falls. She met Joe Moonan through mutual friends when she was attending a teachers’ college in Mankato. They married on November 12, 1912, 
	and settled in Waseca to being our chapter of this story. Grandpa Joe was fond of saying that by the time he was 30 he had five daughters, no teeth, 
	and no hair.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After Rosemary’s death, Joe and Ethel settled into the house. We were surprised to learn, after we were adults, that Grandma and Grandpa were <i>not</i> <!-- would <em> be better? --> 
	enthusiastic about the move. The house was much too big (by that time, only the youngest of their five daughters, Joan, lived at home) and too expensive 
	for their taste, but Joe’s siblings pressured Joe and Ethel to keep the house in the family. Joan told her children that Ethel cried when she found out 
	the move to the brick house was definite. She loved the white frame house (which we think of as <q>Margie’s house</q>) and disliked the brick house. The heavy 
	drapes separating the rooms made the house dark, and the first thing they did was tear out all the drapes. They wanted to replace the worn carpet in the 
	living room, but couldn’t afford it. Joan said that at first she missed the old house, and felt a bit lost in the big mansion. Joan also talked about what 
	it was like to be alone in the house. It made a lot of scary noises and there was no place that you could sit without having either a door or a window 
	behind you. She said it was a spooky place to be alone.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Some of our collective stories of the house come from stories our parents told us of happenings before we were born. One such story is retold by Marilynn:
	</p>
	
	<blockquote><i><p>
	Grandpa and Grandma decided to move to the Waseca Hotel for the winter months of 1940-41 so they wouldn’t have to heat the brick house. It might have 
	seemed an unnecessary move on the morning of November 11, 1940, since the outside thermometer was pushing 60 degrees. Mom, before her marriage, worked at 
	the IRS in St. Paul, and was in the habit of taking the train to Owatonna on Saturdays after work to spend the weekend in Waseca. Dad would pick her up in 
	Owatonna. November 11 was a Monday, so I’m not certain why Mom was heading home...maybe she felt the barometer falling. In any case, she was wearing light 
	fall clothing for the train ride.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	For some reason Mary was alone in Owatonna and decided to take the bus to Waseca to be with the family. Along the way, the bus driver picked up stranded 
	people, among them a young woman from South Dakota who was nearly frozen. Mary brought the young woman to the Waseca Hotel, where they discovered she was 
	the daughter of one of Grandma’s good friends in South Dakota. The young woman thawed out and, from Mom’s telling, they all had a good time being snowed in 
	at the Waseca Hotel.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The storm dissipated the next day. When the family walked up North State Street to take stock of the brick house, they found that the front doors had blown 
	open and there was snow back as far as the staircase.
	</p></i></blockquote>
	
	<p>
	Also not within the memories of most of us are the weddings of the Moonan girls. Photos help fill in the blanks.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	All five of the Moonan Girls lived all or some part of their married lives in Waseca or Owatonna, so most of us had the good fortune of growing up with our 
	grandparents as a steady presence in our lives. Thirteen of the nineteen cousins managed to be born in Waseca, not, for the most part, because the nuclear 
	family resided in Waseca on or birth dates but because our mothers chose to return to their parents, their sisters, and their hometown doctor (Orville Swenson) 
	before giving birth. The brick house had a welcoming, revolving door, with our moms, our dads, and all of the babies coming and going. Grandmas must have been 
	an expert at <i>newborn</i><!-- use <em> for emphasis? --> care. So, from our earliest days, our vision of the brick house emerged as home, as refuge, and as the resort of the 
	transitional, the emerging, the celebrating and the kids checking in for a dose of love.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	But some of us had more <q>quality years</q> in the brick house than others. The Friedel, Walbran and Hough children spent their childhood years at least 
	until after Grandma’s death, in Waseca or Owatonna. The Senn children lived away from Minnesota until their family moved back to Waseca in 1952. And the 
	Pinnell children, already disadvantaged by their late births, also missed out on some wonderful memory-building years by moving away from Waseca in late 
	1956, when Tony was only a baby and before Peggy and Mary were born. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Francie remembers the day the Pinnells left for Missouri: <i>I watched your ar<!--not sure what this means--> pull out of the brick house driveway with my mom and Grandma Moonan. Then we 
	went into the house and Grandma cried. She wondered what would happen to you without her.</i>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Too Young or Memories</h2>
	
	<p>
	Mary, the youngest of us, says, <!--I added quotations for this..--><q>Sadly, I have no memories of the brick house. There is one photo of Grandma holding me as a baby on her lap. I was taken 
	shortly before Grandma died. I think she was sitting in a chair near the bottom off the stairs. I have many happy memories of what I call Aunt Margie’s 
	house. What I would give for the purple bathroom!</q>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Tony and Peggy are in the same boat. (On the bright side, those three youngsters can probably still remember where they left their car keys.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As Pete says, the younger cousins’ memories <i>are more <u>feelings</u> than well-formed images. Trips to Minnesota were always fun and special, and 
	my memories are wrapped up so much with the people who were there. All he aunts were kind and warm, and the uncles always joked around and kidded 
	with us. My clearest mental image is of running I to the house when we first arrived, to meet Grandma walking from the kitchen, drying her hand on 
	her apron and welcoming us with a big smile.</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	And Robbie remembers laughter: <i>No one old make little Joanie, our Mom, laugh like Grandpa Joe Moonan did. The worries of raising seven kids 
	went away when Grandpa made her laugh. Hearing his voice and seeing his mischievous smile Mom just giggled like she was eight years old.</i>
	</p>
	
	<h2> First Memories of Older Cousins </h2>
	
	<p>
	At the other end of the spectrum, some of the older cousins have very clear first memories of the house. Jack says, <i>My first distinct memory 
	in the house was the palpabe<!--not sure what this means--> upset of everyone in the house on hearing the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor, as broadcasts over 
	the great domed radio just to the left of the entry to the library.</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	And Francie adds, <i>My earliest memory of the house was Halloween night, so I would have been two years old. My mother and I had walked over 
	to the Gahler/Gallagher house to trick or treat. We were walking home when Grandpa Joe swooped up in his big Dodge and told my mom to get in – 
	my dad was on the phone and his troop ship had docked in New York. We hustled home and went into the phone closet to talk with him.</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Those of us in the middle of the pack share many of the same memories of the house. So let’s mentally scamper through the house, to see what 
	we remember.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	First, up the front steps. But, if it’s <b>winter</b><!--or use <strong>-->, watch out! There’s an enormous icicle hanging from the front 
	corner that (our mothers warn us) might fall.
	</p>
	
	<h2> Front Entry Room </h2>
	
	<p>
	Then through the sunny front entry room where Grandma displayed her carnival glass. She said it developed color from the sun. This is also 
	where, shortly before Christmas in 1944, when Aunt Margie didn’t know where Uncle Joe was fighting, the mailman delivered a Nazi helmet – 
	just threw it into the front entry room. It was from Uncle Joe, so Margie would know that he was still out there somewhere behind German lines.
	</p>
	
	<h2> Telephone Closet </h2>
	
	<p>
	Then past the telephone closet that seemed <u>so</u> large, filled with furs. Joe remembers picking up the phone to call Francie one day, 
	and the nice operator asked, <q>Are you visiting your grandmother today, Joey?  
	
	<br>
	
	And do you remember Great-Grandpa John’s black shillelagh that was always leaning against the wall?</q> <!-- added a ending quotation mark here, since there was a starting one at the top-->
	</p>
	
	<h2> Third Floor </h2>
	
	<p>
	Then up the staircase, past the window seat at the landing, all the way up to the third floor. The first room to the south, 
	labeled <q>Chamber</q> and <q>Alcove</q> on the architect’s plan, was Joan’s bedroom when she was a teenager. Joan’s bed 
	was built in under the window. There was a little ventilation window between Joan’s room and the big attic. It spooked 
	her, so she had it nailed shut.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
	There was also a bathroom on the third floor. When Senns lived in the house in 1952, Mart said he’d turn on the bath water 
	full blast, sit down on a chair and read <i>Time</i> magazine cover to cover, and<!--took out the comma here--> by that 
	time, the tub would be full.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	And Jack recalls the summer he worked for Emmet at the Experiment Station, sleeping in <q>Joan’s room</q> in the front 
	window bed, and soaking forever in the deep, deep tub in the third floor bathroom.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Then to the big attic. Annie remembers the hours of hunting through beautiful cloths in the trunks in the big attic and 
	descending (tripping down) the staircase, adored in long pearls, flapper dresses, high heels, and wonderful hats.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Do you remember the portrait of the Indian Chief, in full head dress, in the big attic? Grandma told us that she was the 
	daughter of an Indian Chief, and we believed her. After all, Grandma has real artifacts (Indianhead pennies, arrowheads, 
	corn grinding stones…) in her little museum on the wooden radiator cover in <q>Joan’s room.</q>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Mmmmmmmm. The scent of the cedar closet in the third floor hallway.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	There was also a smaller attic where Granma kept stones and shells in boxes for our inspection. A lot of old military 
	uniforms were stored there, and a couple of parachutes Francie’s dad brought back from a captured German supply train.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Joe (with Jack’s help) pushed a big parachute over the third floor stair railing. It was a long drop. The younger 
	cousins got a bit dizzy just <i>looking</i> alllll the way down from the third floor. The parachutes didn’t open, 
	and our mothers panicked when they heard the thump, because they thought a child was attached. We made many small 
	parachutes, some with clothes-pin soldiers, which worked perfectly. And we dropped paper airplane, trying to get 
	them to pull out of a dive at the right moment so they’d fly into the living room and elicit a startled 
	<q>what was that?</q> from own<!-- confused but this word--> of the grown-ups.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember the central vacuum cleaning system? There were little brass flaps in the baseboards, to which the hose was 
	attached. One of us would be on the third floor, the other in the basement. We’d lift the little flaps and 
	<i>WHISPER</i> to each other. A treasure or any child-spy. But if you were not careful to discharge first, you could 
	get a static shock to the lips when speaking through the tubes, courtesy of the wool carpet.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Jack remembers Mrs. Brown using the old <q>plug in</q> vacuum cleaner, from the opening under the hall table due west 
	of the telephone closet. The system regularly stopped up with gobs of lint.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	How about the <q>secret passages</q> that Joe discovered in the attic? Joan also used to talk about a <q>dead space</q> 
	that wasn’t part of any bedroom, but that you could see into somehow. On the Third Floor Plan, you can see that the 
	walled off spaces are basically what was left over after the dormers were plugged into the front of the house. On the 
	back, you had to go atop the hall ceiling from the big attic at the center (It’s open to the underside of the roof) to 
	see down into the two rear walled-off spaces.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As long as we’re reliving our spooky memories: Fran used to say that she saw the ghost of Rosemary Moonan coming 
	down the stairs from the third floor – a sort of benevolent presence, just checking on everybody. Says Reenie: 
	<i>Mom talked about sitting on the stairway during some event (it might have been Rosemary Moonan’s walk) and 
	smelling roses, and she said she smelled roses in the house other times, but I don’t remember her saying she actually 
	<b>saw</b><!--<strong>?--> a ghost</i>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Second Floor</h2>
	
	<p>
	Now, in our imaginations, we’ll scoot down the staircase to the second floor. Grandma’s bedroom was the <q>Boys Room</q> 
	as labeled on the architect’s drawings, and Grandpa’s bedroom was <q>Mr. Moonan’s Room.</q>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The radiator bench next to Grandpa’s bed was always covered with train schedules. He’d eagerly work up a route for you, 
	if you asked. He subscribed to a great railroad magazine full of tales of runaway trains, rains racing through forest 
	fires, steaming wrecks in ravines, trains in deep snow, etc.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	On the door frame in Grandpa’s bathroom were our measurements, take regularly. And the sink in the main bathroom had a 
	third spigot in addition to the standard hot and cold: a tall, curved spigot labeled <q>ice</q>, which brought hard 
	water to the second floor for drinking. Sheila remembers the iron-rich smell and taste. The water softener <q>capsule</q> 
	was in the laundry room hear the vegetable root cellar. (Was there are hard water spigot in the kitchen as well?)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Jack lived at the brick house for about six months after his brother Joe was born in 1941, and off and on for the next 
	two years. The ante-room to Grandpa’s bedroom was the first <q>stay over</q> room for a grandchild, because it was as 
	close as possible to both grandparents. Sometime during WWII, Jack was supposed to be sleeping in that room when Grandma 
	caught him lifting the blackout shades and risking being caught by the blackout wardens (another Indian tale?) who walked 
	around looking for people recklessly displaying lights the enemy could bomb. Jack was looking for the warden. As we got 
	older, we move from ante-room to the impressive middle bedroom (Sheila always felt like a princess when she slept in that 
	room), and then to the southwest bedroom, lighter and airier.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Francie and Margie lived at the brick house from the spring of 1944 until late fall of 1945, most likely using the southwest 
	second floor bedroom. Francie’s dad returned from Europe in November 1945, and all three Friedels lived at the brick house 
	(probably in the idle second floor bedroom) until they moved to the white frame house on Second Street (<q>Margie’s house</q>).
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Fran and the three Hough children lived at the brick house while Ricky was activated (but not deployed overseas) during the 
	Korean War. Dick remembers a curfew whistle (a 10:00 pm?) that would awaken and scare the wits out of him when he was sleeping 
	in the middle bedroom.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The five Senns lived at the brick house for about a half year after they moved back to Waseca so Mart could join Grandpa’s 
	law practice after Grandpa had a stroke. During that time, Fred was quarantined for scarlet fever with the Friedels at 
	Margie’s house, and the rest of the Senn family was quarantined at the brick house. Francie remembers Grandma braiding 
	Barbie’s hair in front of the mirror in the south bedroom Barbie remembers sleeping in the little alcove next to the south 
	sleeping porch after she and Marilynn had tonsillectomies. And the smell of cloves in the closets. Grandma used to cover apples 
	with cloves, and tuck them in her closets to keep things smelling fresh. The Senns moved to their new house the day Eisenhower 
	was elected President, November 4, 1952.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Linda remembers bats and tennis rackets. Once when Marilynn sat for the Pinnell kids at the big house (always a welcome gig, 
	not just because Joan paid at a piece-work rate), long after bedtime (and far into the night) bats flew out of the attic 
	and all over the house. We chased them around with a broom and a tennis racket. The bats escaped. (Mark now has that tennis 
	racket. By coincidence, the name of the racket is <q>The Bat</q>, and the insignia on the racket is dated 1916.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Kitty remembers Grandma teacher her how to knit, sitting in a bedroom with sun coming in the window. (But Kitty never has 
	gotten the mitten thumbs right.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember the wispy curtains blowing at the windows (and later relegated to the trunk in the big attic or dress up)?
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember Grandma’s clip earrings on her dressing table? Once Francie and Sheila made aluminum foil crowns and Sheila 
	used Grandma’s jewelry for decorations. Grandma was not happy.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Grandma also displayed little statutes and knick-knacks in the bedrooms. Like the friendly <q>guardian angel with children</q>, 
	and the spooky life-sized Baby Jesus statue in the small room offer Grandpa’s bedroom. He made us all a little nervous.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Did you know that Grandma painted the face on the Baby Jesus statue? Grandma was an accomplished china painter. Check for 
	her initials on any painted china you have from the house.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The sunny sleeping porch was the playroom. There were never toys scattered around the house. (In fat, were there ever 
	<i>any</i> toys in the house?) There was a row of school desks in the playroom, so we payed school there. And some 
	block that Pat calls <q>Froebel Blocks.</q> Mom said that Grandma was trained to be a kindergarten teacher, and that’s 
	why she was so good at entertaining us. Robby remembers that the teacher-Grandma could tell a children’s story with 
	mesmerizing precision, and always had a private, gentle word for each grandchild. And do you remember how she corrected 
	us if we said we were <i>done</i> doing something? She’d say, <q>Cookies are done. Children are finished.</q>
	</p>
	
	<h2>First Floor</h2>
	
	<p>
	Now let’s go down another flight of fancy – to the first floor. Remember stone school—played on these stairs? The 
	<q>teacher</q> hid a stone in a hand and the <q>students</q> had to guess which hand. The right guess meant we could go 
	up a step.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Dining Room</h2>
	
	<p>
	A right turn takes into the dining room. Grandma and Grandpa had ongoing canasta tournaments on the dining room table. 
	They played at noon when Grandpa came home or lunch, and Francie and Sheila, if they were visiting, played at the other 
	end of the table. Grandma and Grandpa kept a running tab of their scores, and Grandma was always ahead.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	For some years, Mrs. Brown (the only African-American woman in Waseca) helped Grandma with the housework. Raised in the 
	South, Mrs. Brown didn’t think it proper to have lunch with Mrs. Moonan in the dining room, despite Grandma having asked 
	Mrs. Brown to join her.  So, acknowledging Mrs. Brown’s sense of propriety, Grandma ate in the dining room while Mrs. Brown 
	ate in the kitchen, and the two carried on their conversations in raised voices through the butler’s pantry.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	There was a buzzer under the carpet under the table, originally meant to summon the kitchen help. When Jack <i>s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d</i> 
	his leg to buzz it, Mrs. Brown hustled in from the kitchen. Grandma and Mrs. Brown must have reached some accord that gave 
	Jack one buzzer-call per visit, because the rest of us can’t remember any use of the buzzer during <i>real</i> dinners.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Grandma displayed her collection of cast iron trivets, with their unique iron-work designs, on the plate rail along the 
	south wall. During the later years of WWII, when Civilian Defense workers went door to door to collect metal for the war 
	effort (<q>Junk helps make guns, tanks, ships for our fighting men!</q>), Grandma gave up her trivet collection, as well 
	as her collection of flatirons, for the war. (Grandpa also did his part, tending his Victory Garden on the lots behind 
	Margie’s house.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Reenie loved the</b> wonderful built-in cabinets and buffet, filled with beautiful china, pressed glass, and other 
	antique glassware. Grandma knew that Joe was not a good saver, but that he would buy her anything she wanted. So she 
	collected antique glassware, intending it to be her savings. Grandma came home with some little treasure wrapped in 
	brown paper from almost every trip she took with Grandpa. Grandpa did the driving, but did not go into the shop. He 
	was happiest when the shop was in town, close to the coffee shop where he could read the local newspaper and talk with 
	the assembled regulars. In a million ways, Joe and Ethel seemed to fit perfectly together. Under Grandma and Grandpa’s 
	reign, that house was such a warm, loving, and comfortable place, because they love each other deeply, were great friends 
	and companions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Joe: <blockquote><i>One of my sweetest memories is of visiting Grandma and Grandpa overnight, with Jack. Grandma tucked 
	us into bed in the southwest bedroom. Giant bed. We ate breakfast off Blue Willow plates (I now have the platter), 
	for which Grandma had a story of a failed Chinese courtship. There was fresh orange juice in the ruby red glasses.  
	It was magic. Grandpa came down, suited up for work, but somehow out of order. A jacket mis-buttoned or a shirt tail loose. 
	Grandma tidied him up and tied his shoes. It was so  loving. Then Grandpa Joe spread corn and seed on the picnic table 
	for the critters. Jack and I liked to kneel on the warm oak radiator bench in the dining room to watch, as Ethel pointed 
	out the bullying jays. </i></blockquote> 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Many an hour was spent on the warm dining room window seat, watching the squirrels and blue jays going after their treats.....
	Linda remembers the organ on the west wall of the dining room, with knobs you could pull and pedals you could push.....And 
	Sheila recalls draping the WWII parachute over the dining room table and crawling under it, like a big tent.....Dick reminds 
	us that Grandma Ethel’s walk-in china closet was off-limits for hide and seek.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Now let's step through the corner of the living room, past the grand piano on the right, and into the library. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Library</h2>
	
	<p>
	The library, with its pretty glass doors, had a hint of a hush about it. A heavy oak library table dominated 
	the room....Grandma's collection of bride's baskets was kept high on top of the cabinets. The late afternoon 
	sun shone through the colored glass to produce a rainbow of colors....The glass cabinet doors would stick in 
	the summer and come open suddenly, scaring us that they would break.....Grandma used to challenge us to find 
	the one leaded glass panel that was different, due to a repair (north wall, lower right)....At least one among 
	us felt smug that she could open the small drawers under the glass cabinets to find crayons and paper.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The shelves were <i>loaded</i> with books. And there was a special children's section with fairy books; some 
	strangely off-brand, off-beat boys' adventure books, like <i>The Motor Boys in Mexico</i>; a series of books 
	about Constance Dunlop, an early woman detective; and a ten-volume set of <i>Our Wonder World</i>, each thick 
	volume with a theme (<q>The World and Its Peoples</q>, <q>Adventure and Imagination</q>), dating from around 
	1918. There was also a series of small leather-bound books of poems (Robert Burns and others) that <i>seemed</i> 
	like they should be children's books because they were so tiny, but weren't.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Mark remembers that on one of his last visits to the Moonan library, when he was in about seventh grade, he 
	came across a book by Fred Allen, an American humorist and radio personality from the 1940's, containing this 
	repartee: <q>Why would anyone ever want to split an atom?</q>  And the reply, <q>Well, maybe you have a friend.</q>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Living Room</h2>
	
	<p>
	Now into the living room. Do you remember Grandpa Joe playing a ragtime version of Happy Birthday on the piano? 
	And Grandma wetting the tip of her finger and slowly moving it around the rim of the ruby crystal bowl on top 
	of the piano to make it sing?
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The great, great big-taller than any child—dome-shaped radio was in the northwest corner, and the older cousins 
	remember Sunday night gatherings around it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The famous Dog's Head Chair! It was always a scramble to claim sitting rights, held for only a few seconds before 
	being unseated by another sibling or cousin.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember popcorn and root beer in front of the fireplace?....And how terribly hot the steam radiators were?....And 
	the push-button light switches?....And the soft light brown fuzzy walls?....And the purple so-tactile drapes off 
	the living room door? No child, not one, could resist wrapping up in the soft drapes and then twisting. As this 
	was a strain on the wooden rings and their connection to the top, such play would initiate an immediate reprimand 
	from mothers' voices. So we learned the rules.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Let's try to recall the framed art hanging on the living room walls. The Audubon woodpecker print hung on the north 
	wall behind the piano, and we remember John Moonan's portrait. But where was <i>The Angelus</i>, by Jean Francois 
	Millet? And Frans Hals' <i>Laughing Cavalier</i> (we knew him as <q>Hal</q>)?
	</p>
	
	<h2>Sun Room</h2>
	
	<p>
	Now moving south through the living room into the sun room, we remember Grandma sitting and knitting,and we envision 
	stacks of National Geographics on the radiator benches. And the <b><i>not</i></b>-so-organized piles of newspapers. 
	Jack remembers riding with Grandpa to the railroad depots twice a day, to one depot to get the Chicago <i>Tribune</i> 
	and to the other to get either the St. Louis <i>Post Dispatch</i> or the Kansas City <i>Star</i>. The Twin Cities' 
	papers came on the bus.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Grandpa's way of reading the newspaper was brisk. He quickly read through each section, left it turned inside out, and 
	tossed it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	One Sunday morning, Grandma went to the third floor by the stair rail, threw the newspaper up in the air, and let the 
	pages land wherever they happened to fall. Later she told Grandpa: <q>Just once I wanted you to read the newspaper the 
	way it is when I read it.</q>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Back Yard</h2>
	
	<p>
	Now let's go out through the rear foyer, with its musty, nutty smell, where the baskets of birdseed and nuts were kept 
	for spreading on the picnic table in wintertime. Remember the back yard?  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Raking in the fall. The huge pile of leaves, south, beyond the driveway, and the <i>bon fire</i>. Now that was exciting, 
	and the smell of burning leaves is now an EPA-outlawed Proustian impossibility.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	One time, some of the cousins were swinging a rake to knock chestnuts from the tree to gather next to the leaf pile. When 
	Dick finally had his turn with the rake, he lost control and whacked Annie in the head. He was certain he had killed her, 
	and felt terrible....Dick also fondly recalls the time his big cousin Jack was doing work for Joe and Ethel in the back 
	yard, cutting down a fruit tree, and Jack <i>asked</i> Dick to help him. Jack did all the heavy work, but Dick got to 
	shove the logs down the chute and help stack them in the cellar.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In the winter, on the picnic table where there were blue jays and cardinals and chickadees, there were also fox squirrels. 
	Big ones. Bigger than the gray squirrels. Fred, did you sit on the picnic table and get squirrels to eat out of your hand?  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Lilies of the valley and jack-in-the-pulpits in the spring.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Root beer and doughnuts in the yard in the summer. And Fourth of July picnics. One year we had fireworks and sparklers, 
	and Margie was really worried someone was going to get hurt.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Grandma had a beautiful old-fashioned flower garden by the back driveway and Grandpa had that big vegetable garden behind 
	the garage, plus his many fruit trees, which went way to the back of the property, where we had a swing set. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember climbing the apple tree at the back of the property? And trying to find a way to investigate the second floor of 
	the garage? There were interesting things stored up there. It was a place we were NOT supposed to go. But some of us did. 
	It had the dustiest attic.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Let's head back toward the house, circling north past the door we exited, and entering the door near the kitchen. (OK, Dick, 
	you may run around front to check the sign posted on the telephone pole to see if the Waseca Braves are playing tonight.)
	</p>
	
	<h2>Kitchen</h2>
	
	<p>
	The room off the kitchen was like a cold porch. The stairs from the kitchen to the basement were mysterious, like a secret 
	stairway in a Hardy Boys novel. They were very steep and we were not supposed to use them....Joan remembers tramps coming 
	to the kitchen door and being fed sandwiches during the Depression. Jack also experienced that a few times during the war 
	years....Remember Grandma using the mangle in the kitchen, and the fragrance of fresh, laundered sheets? That mangle was a 
	fascinating apparatus to see at work. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Because kids were generally kept out of the kitchen, that's the part of the house the younger cousins remember least, but 
	the older ones can give us a guided tour: 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The kitchen was light yellow. North wall: high windows, about six-feet wide. Great white porcelain double sink with dish 
	drains on both sides, centered on the wall.....White porcelain/metal table in the center of the kitchen, extending from the 
	left end of the dish drain. (Fred points out that, if potato salad was on the menu, there were <i>two</i> bowls of it on this 
	table: one big bowl of potato salad with onions, and one small bowl <i>without</i> onions; Grandpa was allergic to onions.) 
	Two white, painted kitchen chairs.....West wall: far left, the door to the basement. Kelvinator refrigerator to the right of 
	the door. When the mangle was in the kitchen, it must have been to the right of the refrigerator.....South wall: centered, a 
	white porcelain/metal storage cabinet, five to six feet wide, with bottom storage, counter, and upper storage. Most pots and 
	pans were there.....East wall: The large white oven/stove was centered on the east wall. The stove had 6 burners,or 4 burners 
	plus a griddle, under a liftable cover. Far right, the bi-swing door to the butler's pantry (sort of an airlock between the 
	kitchen and the dining room), which you walked through, first straight and then a hard right, to enter the dining room through 
	another bi-swing door.....The butler's pantry was lined with wood cabinets, and had a window to the back yard—too high for a 
	child to see out.....There were always round pink peppermints, Grandpa's favorite, in a tin in the butler's pantry....
	</p>
	
	<p>
	While we're in the kitchen, how about a piece of Sunshine Cocoa Cake? The special ingredient was acquired by having a grandchild 
	stand outside for twenty minutes or so, pointing the mouth of a big jar at the sun, then putting the cap on the jar and bringing 
	it inside. Coincidentally, that was just the time Grandma needed to mix the other ingredients. The jar uncapped, the last ingredient 
	was poured carefully into the batter.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Cellar</h2>
	
	<p>
	Now down the forbidden, steep stairs into the cellar. We loved the Victrola (<q>If You Knew Susie</q>), but the cellar had a dank, 
	ancient-house, basement smell, and was a little spooky. There was a scary, dark water cistern under the vegetable cellar room.....
	Remember catching tiny frogs in the cistern drain? 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The furnace room, with the automatic coal feeder (the engine room on a great ship might look like that!), was directly below the sun 
	room—hence the very hot radiators. The coal was stored in its own separate room under the entry foyer. The coal chute was just around 
	the back corner.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Christmas</h2>
	
	<p>
	Emerging from the cellar, let's return to the expanses of the main floor to reminisce about Christmas (which never could be <i>mentioned</i> 
	until after Thanksgiving). In the late afternoon on Christmas Day, our families gathered at the brick house, bearing little presents for 
	our cousins. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Sheila remembers helping Grandma and our mothers sort our gifts in the library before bringing them to the radiator benches in the sun room. 
	One year, when Dick was quite young and playing in the library by himself, he discovered the wrapped presents. He unwrapped most of them 
	before Grandma found him. He can still hear Grandma's admonishment.
	</p>

	<p>
	Each of us found a small pile of presents on the window-seat benches in the sun room. Grandpa always gave each grandchild a silver dollar.
	</p>

	<p>
	After opening our gifts, we sat around our grandparents in their chairs near the fireplace, watching them open their gifts. Dinner was a buffet, 
	set up in the dining room. We used those square metal trays with fillers.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The grown-ups ate in the dining room, and the kids ate at card tables in various other rooms. The older cousins usually ate in the library, the 
	younger cousins in the sun room (where there were no breakable glass doors). After all the festivities, our mothers escaped to the kitchen to 
	clean up from the feast. We kids were barred from entry to the kitchen, even for a drink of water, until all the dishes had been washed and put away.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Outside, it was dark and cold. Inside, it could not have been brighter or warmer.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	On New Year's Eve, some of us stayed overnight, making beds out of chairs and blankets around the big old radio, waiting for midnight in Times Square. 
	Who knew it was not really midnight for us?
	</p>
	
	<h2>Grandma's Wake</h2>
	
	<p>
	Reenie: <i>Grandma's wake is quite vivid in my memory. I remember sitting on the window seat in the dining room listening to our great aunts 
	- Grace, Kathleen, and Helen. I didn't remember ever meeting them before and was rather fascinated by their very distinctively different (and strong) 
	personalities.</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Ann: <i>My last and perhaps most poignant memory of the brick house: On the day of Grandma's funeral, I was standing near the piano in the living 
	room and I watched Grandpa enter the library where Grandma was serenely and beautifully lying. He knelt down next to her, prayed silently for a few moments, 
	stood and gently bent down and kissed her goodbye.</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Marilynn: <i>One more vivid memory from the day of Grandma Moonan's funeral: The house was filled with relatives, many of whom I didn't know but 
	who had a familiar <q>Moonan</q> look. I sat on the bottom step of the staircase and listened to the conversations among the cousins of our mothers' 
	generation as they went up and down reminiscing about all the fun they had in the brick house. It was uncanny. All of the wonders we're sharing now 
	were cast back a generation.</i> 
	</p>
	
	<h2>The House After Joe and Ethel</h2>
	
	<p>
	Mark: <blockquote><i>Grandma Moonan died on March 21, 1962, and Grandpa sold the house not too long afterward to Helen and Dan Sullivan, who moved down from 
	St. Paul. Helen was Grandpa's sister, our great aunt. She earned her Master's Degree in History. She married Dan Sullivan, whose father was an early investor 
	in 3M. The two of them taught at Bemidji State College and were childless. The suggestion was they led a glamorous life. He played a ukulele. They smoked. 
	Helen had an early version of an electric air freshener machine on the end table next to her chair. I recall she was quite pretty and he handsome in an older 
	way. I visited them with Mom and Dad from time to time. They were nice, interesting, and interested in me. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After Helen and Dan bought the home, they closed off the third floor to conserve heat, refinished the basement, and built a double garage just outside the back 
	door. Helen and Dan stored two Cadillacs in the new garage—a sedan and a two-door coupe. The old carriage house continued to stand east of the new garage, at 
	least until about the time the Sullivans sold the house to the Driessens in 1964. 
	</p></i></blockquote>
	
	<p>
	Grandpa moved into a first floor apartment across from the Waseca Hotel and kitty-korner from the courthouse, about a block from the law office above the bank. 
	He continued to be a vital and fun-loving presence in our lives, meeting us for breakfast at the Busy Bee on Saturday mornings, dropping by our mothers' homes 
	for coffee or dinner, taking groups of the grandkids out for supper at the Fox Inn....Grandpa died on June 9, 1966, after suffering a heart attack while climbing 
	the stairs to his office. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Closing</h2>
	
	<p>
	Pete says, <i>As for the house, I loved <b>everything</b> about it. The big rooms, beautiful woodwork, <q>beams</q> on the ceilings, glass cabinets, 
	push-button light switches, stained glass, the phone closet, the sun room (which, in my memory, is always sunny), the <u>attic</u> (what could be more wonderful 
	than a big attic, with all kinds of spaces to explore, not to mention old clothes for costumes), the bathrooms with little porcelain tiles on the floor, the 
	vacuum tubes in the walls, and that incredible stairway.</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Pat: <i>There's a classic old book from architectural theory lala-land, by a French fellow, Gaston Bachelard, called <u>The Psychology of the House</u>. 
	He goes through the characteristic spaces of a house, attic to basement, and unpacks their significance and feel, especially for children. When I've designed houses 
	for clients with children, I've tried to incorporate some of those ideas. The Moonan house has character in spades.</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Mark tells one more story:
	<blockquote><i><b>
	It was a fall day. Most of the things for sale were out in the yard—in fact I think the house was not open. Down by the carriage house, the auctioneer was taking bids. 
	And there—in a nice frame—was the portrait (May I say iconic? We all know the portrait; there were several copies) of Great Grandpa John, <q>Old Top</q> himself, 
	inadvertently left behind, and the bidding was on. A nicely dressed couple was bidding on the portrait and other bidders responded. What the hell?? I thought. They're 
	bidding on our patrimony! I started to raise the bid in $1.00 increments. I think it got to something like $75.00 before the auctioneer paused and asked me, <q>Young 
	man, does this picture mean something to you?</q> I replied, <q>That's my Grandpa!</q> (plaintively, foregoing the generational nicety) and the auctioneer took a break 
	in the bidding. (This was a good thing because I had about $5.00 in my pocket.) 
	
	<p>
	I ran up to the front stoop of the house and found Uncle Joe Friedel talking with some friends, and I related the fix I was in. I asked if he'd stake me; he said 
	he would and returned with me to the carriage house. Uncle Joe and the auctioneer had a little visit (the bidding couple was only interested in the frame and 
	agreed to forego their purchase), and afterwards we brought Great Grandpa John home to Margie’s house.
	</p>
	</b></i></blockquote>
	
	<p>
	<b><!--[this sentence was from text in dropbox] This photo was taken at the Hough home on Havana Road in Owatonna after Reenie's wedding.--> 
	In this photo, Pat and I are toasting Great Grandpa John at the Hough home on Havana Road in Owatonna after Reenie’s wedding (I was an usher. You know the lament: 
	<q>Always an usher, never a groom.</q>). Rick and Fran had decorated their garage as an Irish Pub, including Great Grandpa John's portrait over a fake fireplace 
	and a bar made with one of the green doors from Margie's house.</b>
