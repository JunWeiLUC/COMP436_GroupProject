<h2>The Big Brick House Project </h2>

    <p>When word reached the 19 grandchildren of Joe and Ethel Moonan in late-2009 that the big brick Moonan family house in Waseca was for sale, they suddenly found ourselves immersed in a flurry of e-mailed remembrances about childhood years, grandparents, and their connections to the house. They collected shared memories and photos into a “MyPublisher” book they gave to the new owners (and to themselves). They realized in the process that the house represented their true sense of “place.” <p> 

    <p> The "tonef the book reflects a few different editorial styles. One appears to be telling a story, perhaps to a grandchild; another offers a small treatise on architecture of the house. With 19 cousins offering input into the book - stories, recollections, images, and questions, some with just a short comments, others rather garrulous..</p>

<p>Following the publication of the book, more photos were found, more stories recalled, a brief recording of Joe Moonan and Fran Hough playing a duet on the baby grand, more everything, called for a "book" in a form that was more extensible</p>

<p><i>“No place is a place until things that have happened in it are remembered in history, ballads, yarns, legends, or monuments.” </i><a href="https://wallacestegner.org"> William Stegnner</a> <b>The Sense of Place</b>.

   <i>There's a classic old book from architectural theory lala-land by Gaston Bachelard called the <u>Poetics of Space</u> He goes through the characteristic spaces of a house, attic to basement, and unpacks their significance and feel, especially for children. When I've deesigned houses for clients with children I've tried to incorporate some of those ideas. </i>The Moonan house has character in spades."
