  <h2> Third Floor </h2>
	
	<p>
			<div style="float:left;">
	<div style="margin: 10px; width:250px"><img src="images/thirdflooralcove.jpg" alt="icon" width = "100%"></div>
	<center><figcaption><b><i>Alcove</i></b></figcaption></center>
	</div>
	Then up the staircase, past the window seat at the landing, all the way up to the third floor. The first room to the south, 
	labeled <q>Chamber</q> and <q>Alcove</q> on the architect’s plan, was Joan’s bedroom when she was a teenager. Joan’s bed 
	was built in under the window. There was a little ventilation window between Joan’s room and the big attic. It spooked 
	her, so she had it nailed shut.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
	There was also a bathroom on the third floor. When Senns lived in the house in 1952, Mart said he’d turn on the bath water 
	full blast, sit down on a chair and read <i>Time</i> magazine cover to cover, and<!--took out the comma here--> by that 
	time, the tub would be full.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	And Jack recalls the summer he worked for Emmet at the Experiment Station, sleeping in <q>Joan’s room</q> in the front 
	window bed, and soaking forever in the deep, deep tub in the third floor bathroom.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Then to the big attic. Annie remembers the hours of hunting through beautiful cloths in the trunks in the big attic and 
	descending (tripping down) the staircase, adored in long pearls, flapper dresses, high heels, and wonderful hats.
	</p>
	
	<p>
				<div style="float:left;">
	<div style="margin: 10px; width:250px"><img src="images/thirdfloor-indian.jpg" alt="icon" width = "100%"></div>
	<center><figcaption><b><i>Indian</i></b></figcaption></center>
	</div>
	Do you remember the portrait of the Indian Chief, in full head dress, in the big attic? Grandma told us that she was the 
	daughter of an Indian Chief, and we believed her. After all, Grandma has real artifacts (Indianhead pennies, arrowheads, 
	corn grinding stones…) in her little museum on the wooden radiator cover in <q>Joan’s room.</q>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Mmmmmmmm. The scent of the cedar closet in the third floor hallway.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	There was also a smaller attic where Granma kept stones and shells in boxes for our inspection. A lot of old military 
	uniforms were stored there, and a couple of parachutes Francie’s dad brought back from a captured German supply train.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Joe (with Jack’s help) pushed a big parachute over the third floor stair railing. It was a long drop. The younger 
	cousins got a bit dizzy just <i>looking</i> alllll the way down from the third floor. The parachutes didn’t open, 
	and our mothers panicked when they heard the thump, because they thought a child was attached. We made many small 
	parachutes, some with clothes-pin soldiers, which worked perfectly. And we dropped paper airplane, trying to get 
	them to pull out of a dive at the right moment so they’d fly into the living room and elicit a startled 
	<q>what was that?</q> from one of the grown-ups.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember the central vacuum cleaning system? There were little brass flaps in the baseboards, to which the hose was 
	attached. One of us would be on the third floor, the other in the basement. We’d lift the little flaps and 
	<i>WHISPER</i> to each other. A treasure or any child-spy. But if you were not careful to discharge first, you could 
	get a static shock to the lips when speaking through the tubes, courtesy of the wool carpet.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Jack remembers Mrs. Brown using the old <q>plug in</q> vacuum cleaner, from the opening under the hall table due west 
	of the telephone closet. The system regularly stopped up with gobs of lint.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	How about the <q>secret passages</q> that Joe discovered in the attic? Joan also used to talk about a <q>dead space</q> 
	that wasn’t part of any bedroom, but that you could see into somehow. On the Third Floor Plan, you can see that the 
	walled off spaces are basically what was left over after the dormers were plugged into the front of the house. On the 
	back, you had to go atop the hall ceiling from the big attic at the center (It’s open to the underside of the roof) to 
	see down into the two rear walled-off spaces.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As long as we’re reliving our spooky memories: Fran used to say that she saw the ghost of Rosemary Moonan coming 
	down the stairs from the third floor – a sort of benevolent presence, just checking on everybody. Says Reenie: 
	<blockquote>Mom talked about sitting on the stairway during some event (it might have been Rosemary Moonan’s walk) and 
	smelling roses, and she said she smelled roses in the house other times, but I don’t remember her saying she actually 
	<b>saw</b> a ghost.</blockquote>
